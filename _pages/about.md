I’m a professional violinist passionate about chamber music, orchestral performance, and music education. I’ve performed with ensembles across the country and maintain a vibrant teaching studio for students of all levels.

I studied at the Eastman School of Music, where I developed a love for expressive interpretation and ensemble collaboration. When I’m not performing, you’ll find me exploring new repertoire or mentoring young musicians.
