# Private Lessons

Welcome to my private studio! I am currently offering lessons for both violin and viola, ages 10 and up. 

# Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers around the belief that musical instruction should be individually tailored to the student, their needs, and aspirations.I strive to arm my students with the tools to become not just great musicians, but also Â great thinkers and lifelong learners. Â As a teacher, one of my primary objectives is to help each student find their own musical voice and what they are most passionate about.
